# HailoRT #

HailoRT is a light-weight and production-grade run-time library, which runs on the host processor, and
implements a robust user-space run-time library (HailoRT Library) responsible for operating a Hailo device, with intuitive APIs in C/C++ for optimized performance.

HailoRT is comprised of the following main components:
- HailoRT Library.
- HailoRT CLI - command line application used to control the Hailo device, run inference using the device,
 collect inference statistics and device events, etc.
- [**HailoRT PCIe Driver**](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailort-drivers) - the device driver used to manage the Hailo device, communicate with the device and transfer
    data to/from the device. The PCIe driver includes the Hailo-8 firmware that runs on the Hailo device, manages the boot and control of the Hailo device.
- pyHailoRT - HailoRT Python API (wraps the run-time library)
- HailoRT GStreamer element (HailoNet).

HailoRT supports Linux and Windows, and can be compiled from sources to be integrated with various x86 and ARM processors.
