 * @file mapped_buffer.hpp
 * @brief The mapped buffer that is continuous in virtual memory, but not on physical memory.
 *        We map the buffer to the IOMMU.
 * 
 * The buffer can be used only with the help of a descriptors list that contains pointers to a physical
 * continuous "dma pages".
 * 
 * There are 2 options to allocated the buffer:
 *      1. User mode allocation - the user mode calls `malloc` or `mmap` to allocate the buffer, then
 *         using HailoRTDriver we map the driver to the IOMMU (and pin the pages to avoid pagigs).
 *         This is the default option
 *      2. Kernel mode allocation - on some systems, the user mode doesn't allocate the memory in a "dma-able" address,
 *         so we need to allocate the pages in driver.
